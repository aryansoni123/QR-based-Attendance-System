# Attendance Management System

## Overview

This is a Python-based Attendance Management System that enables both students and teachers to interact with the system. Students can log in, scan QR codes to mark their attendance, and view their attendance records. Teachers can generate QR codes for their classes, view student attendance, and manage class data.

The system uses QR codes for attendance verification and Wi-Fi SSID checking to ensure students are in the right network before marking attendance.

## Features

### Teacher Features:
- **Login**: Teachers can log in using their credentials.
- **Generate QR Codes**: Teachers can generate class-specific QR codes for students to scan and mark their attendance.
- **View Attendance**: Teachers can view and manage the attendance records of all students in their class.
- **CSV Export**: Teachers can save attendance data in a CSV file for easy management.

### Student Features:
- **Login**: Students can log in using their credentials.
- **Scan QR Code**: Students can scan QR codes generated by teachers to mark their attendance.
- **View Attendance**: Students can view their attendance records across various subjects.

### Additional Features:
- **Wi-Fi Network Verification**: Attendance is only marked when the student is connected to a specific Wi-Fi network (`EXPECTED_WIFI`) to prevent misuse.
- **QR Code Scanning**: QR codes are generated dynamically by the teacher and scanned by the student to authenticate and mark attendance.
  
## Requirements

To run this system, you'll need the following Python packages:

- **Tkinter**: For the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **Pillow**: For image manipulation (resizing QR codes).
- **OpenCV**: For scanning QR codes.
- **pandas**: To manage attendance data in CSV format.
- **pyzbar**: To decode QR codes.
- **subprocess**: To check the connected Wi-Fi network.

### Install the required dependencies:
You can install all dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install opencv-python pandas pyzbar pillow qrcode tkintertable
